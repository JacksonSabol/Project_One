            <li>Our motivation is to create a personal space for travel recommendations that is sharable (by searching your username). Often times people keep lists of places and restaurants they have been while traveling, but there is not an app commonly used to store this information and easily share it. 
                </li>
            <li>We are hoping to fix the problem of receiving an overwhelming amount of reviews from strangers on the internet, so that you can narrow down your recommendations from people you know, or want to directly search for (ex: maybe a blogger). This will also include geotag suggestions so that when you are searching for a restaurants you can confirm it is the correct one based on location specifics, etc.
              </li>
            <li>We want to create a platform to find sources of travel info with people you highly trust or recommended sources.
